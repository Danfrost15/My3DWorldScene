# My3DWorldScene
This is a simple 3D scene I created in Unity. It features a small campsite with  a campfire, and props like beds ,floors ,bottles ,chest ,boxes, placed near a calm lake. I used the Unity Terrain Editor to shape the land and the Kenney Survival Kit for the models. The goal was to learn how to build a basic environment, work with assets, and create a peaceful outdoor vibe. Still a work in progress, but a fun learning experience!

Sure! Here's how you can add simple instructions to your GitHub README so others know how to view your Unity scene:

### üì¶ Sources & Assets Used

* 3D Models:
  I used the free **[Kenney Survival Kit](https://kenney.nl/assets/survival-kit)** for tents, crates, campfire, and other props. Kenney assets are great for beginners and free to use for any project and Unity Assets Store.

* Terrain Tools:
  Unity‚Äôs built-in Terrain Editor was used to sculpt the landscape, paint textures, and add trees and grass.

* Environment Elements:

  * Water/Lake: Made using Unity's default Water (Basic) asset or a custom flat plane with a material.
  * Trees and Grass: Added using Unity's terrain vegetation brushes.

All assets used are either free or open for personal and educational use. Credit goes to the original creators where required.
